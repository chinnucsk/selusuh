<ul>
<li>Cluster state
<ul>
<li>The data that's stored in The Ring (coming up shortly) is the global state of the system</li>
<li>Management/synching of this state across the nodes is handled by <code>riak_core</code> using a \"gossip protocol\"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Using Riak Core for your distributed apps means that anything above or below the Riak Core application can be agnostic of scale!</p>
