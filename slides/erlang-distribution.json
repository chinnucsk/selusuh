<ul>
<li>Erlang VM has built-in support for distribution</li>
<li>Processes communicate via messages built on primitives that remain the same regardless of the target node</li>
<li>Distribution of work can happen by simply addressing the messages to processes on different nodes</li>
<li>Development of distributed systems like Riak is drastically simplified thanks to these features<ul>
<li>No extra libs</li>
<li>Inter-application comms is a breeze</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Riak <em>Loves</em> Distribution</strong></li>
