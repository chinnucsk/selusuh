<ul>
<li>Partitioning and work distribution
<ul>
<li>Master/worker configuration on each node to manage execution work units</li>
<li>Consistent hashing determines the nodes to do the work while the master process on the target nodes gives work to the workers</li>
<li>API for advertising and locating services around the cluster (handy for finding \"special\" nodes)</li>
<li>Deals with Hinted Handoff</li>
<li>Implementing a custom vnode is as \"simple\" as creating an Erlang module which implements the <code>riak_core_vnode</code> behaviour</li>
